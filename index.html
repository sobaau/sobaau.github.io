          I am David Preston, a final year Bachelor of Computer Science student majoring in Software
          Development
          with demonstrated experience in IT Technical Support. I am interested in making the transition to
          software developer and as such, have developed various projects in a variety of frameworks which you
          can
          view below. I enjoy experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks in my spare time and
          always strive to evolve my knowledge in software development.

                Classic Asteroid game made in the Processing language. Worked with two other students to
                create
                the
                game over the course of a month. Worked on and created the following compenets: <ul>

                  <li>Star Map backgrond</li>

                ReactShips is a clone of the classic board game Battle Ships. The game is built using
                React
                and
                Typescript on the front end and Express.js on the backend with MongoDB used for database
                storage.
                The front end and the backend communcaite using websockets to send game moves and chat
                messages.

                This project was a class wide effort over the duration of 3 months. In this project the
                class
                was
                tasked with creating a 2D minecraft with the emphisis on Test Driven Deisng and CD/CI
                using
                Jenkins
                and Gitlab. The class was split into teams of 4 with a total of 18 groups.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within my team I worked on a JavaFX test window that enabled us to test our feature
                before
                it
                was
                merged into the master branch, Along with this I worked on the Physics module to create
                basic
                forces
                such things as gravity and water.

              <h3>Genetic Algorithm - Python</h3>
            </div>
            <div>

              <p>
                This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to attempt to solve a pre-provided Zebra Puzzle
                The
                target
                is to get 15 of the hints correct from the Zebra Puzzle and hence find the answer to the
                question:
                <br>
                Which car was going to Port Macquarie? Which car was hired by a Canadian couple?
                <br>
                This is done by using constraints from the hints and using True or False (1 and 0) to
                calculate
                the total right hints and then fitness of that table on a scale of 0 to 1.
              </p>
              <p>
                To avoid duplicates in the answer the AI is punished within the fitness function if any
                duplicates are found. Mating pool selection is performed with a Tournament Selection of
                1000
                rounds and 40 fighters, The 40 fighters selected can not be in the current mating pool
                and
                will
                be reselected if they are. The single strongest of these fighters are then added to the
                mating
                pool which will have a total size of 1000. After this the Parents are picked at random
                from
                the
                mating pool, These parents can not be the same parent. The Child is created from these
                Parents
                by selecting random parts of their tables to crossover and then once this is finished
                the
                child
                is mutated in random locations depending on the mutation rate provided. To avoid any
                Premature
                Convergence and hence stalling of the Algorithm it is restarted after 100 iterations.
